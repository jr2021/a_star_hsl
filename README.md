# Route Planner

At [The University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) I leveraged the [A* Search Algorithm](https://medium.com/anubhav-shrimal/perceptron-algorithm-1b387058ecfb) in [citymap.py](https://github.com/jr2021/travel_planner/blob/master/src/citymap.py) to return the optimal route to a destinaton on the [HSL](https://www.hsl.fi/en) public transit system.

## Languages and Frameworks

## Acknowledgements
